In this project, we set three objectives to achieve:  
  ● To effectively predict patients with heart disease by using machine learning 
  algorithms.  
  ● To determine which characteristics or factors are most crucial for accurately 
  predicting heart disease. 
  ● To determine which machine learning technique is the most effective for the heart 
  disease data set.
